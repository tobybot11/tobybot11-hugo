# Experiences with Azure :wink:


* Love the free tier.. but come on you are in an arms race if GCE gives you $300 then you give $300.. not $200
* I spend so much time diving thru the docs .. figuring out 'classic' vs 'azure' focus.. 
* Nothing changes WRT MSFT software.. infinite features, bloated and overrought documentation written by automotons, no life , no love, and immpossible to get help with
