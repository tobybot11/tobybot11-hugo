# 1st experiences with the current verinos of Azure :wink:

* Love the free tier.. but come on you are in an arms race. if GCE gives you $300 then you give $300.. not $200
* I spend so much time diving thru the docs .. figuring out 'classic' vs 'azure' focus.. 
* Nothing changes WRT MSFT software.. infinite features, bloated and overrought documentation written by automotons, no life , no love, and immpossible to get help within
* This VNet-to-VNet thing between regions is crazy and frought with issues.. only needed cuz the free tier has 4 cores quota.. total BS
* I made 5 vms .. 4 in one region and 1 in another .. and there are literally 35 resources I have to sift thru.. how does this experience scale to 100 VMs?
* Tried the az cli .. That sucks so I switch back and forth between the az cli which is in the azure docs.. and the azure-cli which was in homebrew.. azure-cli is much better.
