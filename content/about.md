# Me / Toby / tobybot11

I am constantly searching for something.
Right now I'm searching for a way to create a SaaS entity all by my lonesome. :-) :smile:

# Hugo / The go tool I used to create this site. 

Hugo is a static site engine written in Go.
Proof Point #1 that every thing, including Jeykll, needed to be rewritten in go. ;-) :wink:

It makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
* [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
* [J Walter Weatherman](https://github.com/spf13/jWalterWeatherman)
* [Cast](https://github.com/spf13/cast)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/spf13).

### Setup

Some fun facts about [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/):

* Built in [Go](http://golang.org/)
* Loosely inspired by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* Primarily developed by [spf13](http://spf13.com/) on the train while commuting to and from Manhattan.
* Coded in [Vim](http://vim.org) using [spf13-vim](http://vim.spf13.com/)

Have questions or suggestions about Hugo? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/new) or [ask spf13 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/spf13).

Thanks for reading!
